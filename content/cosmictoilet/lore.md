# The Lore

Space was fine until the timelines got soggy. Paper hands everywhere. Red candles crying. Then a porcelain portal opened — glowing magenta on one side, cyan on the other — and started swallowing bad vibes like they were yesterday's takes. 

Every flush deletes a frown. Every swirl prints a tiny rocket. No priests. No promises. Just porcelain and velocity. 

When bears growl, we **flush**. When bulls run, we **orbit**. 

If you needed a sign, this one swirls: **FLUSH THE BEAR. ORBIT THE BULL. DIAMOND FLUSH ONLY.** 

Hydrate. Then pull.
